# JS30 - 30 Days of JavaScript

This repository is for code written during the 30 day vanilla JS coding challenge with my friend @brent-harrison1.

## Contributing

_All examples that begin with `$` are intended to be run from your command-line._

1. Clone the repository (ex: `$ git clone https://github.com/joelbowen/js30 && cd js30`)
2. Create a git branch that represents your work (ex: `$ git checkout -b joelbowen/day1` )
3. Change directories into the folder for the day you're working on (ex: `$ cd 01\ -\ JavaScript\ Drum\ Kit/`)  
   _Bonus: You can start typing the name of the folder in Terminal and press tab for auto-complete!_
4. Copy Wes's files into a folder with your own name (ex: `$ cp -a wesbos joelbowen`)  
   _Bonus: use your github username: `$ cp -a wesbos $(git config --global user.name)`_
5. [Commit](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/) changes often – starting with your copy of the starting files. When you're ready, push your branch to github (ex, if you are a contributor: `$ git push -u origin joelbowen/day1`) and then [create a Pull Request using the Github UI](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
6. Profit. And if you have questions, ask me!

\_Note: For extra fun, I've removed the completed solutions that were in the original js30 repo. If you gottahaveemall, check out the original on Wes's github: [https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)
